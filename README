This is an implementation of a conditional Huffman coding, a variation on Huffman coding.
In this variation, each triplet of characters such as 'dac' has a set of huffman code trees associated with it.
These Huffman codes are generated by taking into account the frequency of the letters that come after each occurence of
the triplet in the corpus. Hence, "conditional".

 This results in MUCH more trees, but at the expense of time (for generating all these trees) and space (storing them),
  we hopefully achieve a more efficient coding.
